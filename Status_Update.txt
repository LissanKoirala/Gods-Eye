What happened:
- RTMP server has now been set up.
- Now the users can stream over to the RTMP server and my python script can access it, in high quality.

To do:
- Now i will create a android application that streams the webcam to the RTMP server
- Then a website that also streams the webcam data to the RTMP server

Ideas:
- Now the high end server can access the video from the linode server via rtmp and now analyze the video feed so that it will be quicker and 
  now it can also be distributed between various servers as each can every stream can be grabbed individually. 

Next steps:
- Make the database that will now store the faces and the locations, etc.
