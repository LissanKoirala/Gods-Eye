Now also add the funcionality to search in data breaches so that we can know more about the person we are finding for,
also it will collect information form social medias, phone numbers and perform an OSNIT investigation. 

We could also send phising emails to the person to aquire more informations from them. 
For example, send them a email from a similar serivce they like and make them login in with a prefilled
email input, then they will input passwords that they think is most likely what they used, we will say 
it's incorecct for every password so we can gather as much probable passwords as possible form them. 
Now with the passwords that we gather from the website, we try those passwords in their other social media 
accounts and services.

For the streams that is not in the main locations where the suspect is, 
upload the streams to google drive as we have 600 GB free usuage with Google Workspace. 
Then we will use the Google Cloud Shell to process those
data as we have 50 hours of computation per week to use.


Once the person has been found open the page in full screen mode:
https://earth.google.com/web/search/{geo-coordinates}
Better if this page can be opened in custom browser so that it looks better,
instead opening it in google chrome. If on the main computer or also put a link for
google earth in the website if user is looking it form a brower elsewhere. 


# Customization of the admin panel

To customize admin panel, edit the file:

What happened:
- RTMP server has now been set up.
- Now the users can stream over to the RTMP server and my python script can access it, in high quality.

To do:
- Now i will create a android application that streams the webcam to the RTMP server
- Then a website that also streams the webcam data to the RTMP server

Ideas:
- Now the high end server can access the video from the linode server via rtmp and now analyze the video feed so that it will be quicker and 
  now it can also be distributed between various servers as each can every stream can be grabbed individually. 

Next steps:
- Make the database that will now store the faces and the locations, etc.
